# EarthlingAI Coding Challenge #1

## Overview

This repository contains a starting point for the EarthlingAI Full Stack Developer styling challenge. Your task is to create a visually appealing project display for the dataset that will be provided to you.

## Challenge Requirements

### Setup Instructions

1. Clone this repository to your local machine
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`
3. Start the development server with `npm start`
4. Verify the application runs correctly at http://localhost:3000

### Task Description

At the start of the interview, you will be provided with a URL to a dataset. Your challenge is to:

1. Fetch the dataset (either manually or within your script)
2. Create a visually appealing way to display this data
3. Ensure your design is intuitive and user-friendly

### Technical Requirements

- **Time Limit**: 60 minutes maximum (though it can be completed in ~20 minutes)
- **Code Organization**: You may place all your code in `App.jsx` or create additional component files. We will assess your ability to create reusable, modular components with clear separation of concerns
- **Styling**: `styled-components` is preferred and pre-installed
- **Available Libraries**:
  - `three.js` and `@react-three/fiber` are pre-installed for 3D visualizations
  - `@react-three/drei` is available for additional 3D helpers
  - You may install additional libraries if needed

### Assessment Criteria

You will be evaluated on:

1. **Visual Design**: Overall aesthetic appeal and creativity
2. **Data Representation**: How effectively you display the project data
3. **Information Selection**: Showing relevant data without overwhelming the user
4. **Code Organization**: Component architecture, reusability, structure and readability
5. **Completion Time**: Relative speed compared to other candidates

### Submission Process

When you have completed the challenge:

1. Fork this repository as a private repository on GitHub
2. Grant access to GitHub users "anjumanraut" and "ma-halo"
3. Do not push changes after the 60-minute limit (this will result in disqualification)

## Technical Notes

### Example Components

- A rotating 3D cube with the EarthlingAI logo is provided as an unrelated example
- You can freely modify or remove any components from App.jsx as needed
- The example is not related to the challenge - it's just a basic demonstration of 3D capabilities

### Tips for Success

- Focus on creating an intuitive user interface that clearly represents the data
- Consider visual hierarchy, spacing, and typography
- Balance visual appeal with performance considerations
- Think about how a user would interact with your interface
- Pay attention to responsive design considerations

## Getting Started with React

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
